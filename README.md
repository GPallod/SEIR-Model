# SEIR-Model

I modelled the trajectory of an infectious disease using the Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Removed (SEIR) Model. It has 4 sets of differential equations. I programmed and solved it using the step-euler method, with minor improvements.

Inspired from Udacity Course - "Differential Equations in Action", Problem Set 3: Contagion.
